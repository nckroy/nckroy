- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nicole Roy

I used to be a systems engineer, then I wrote middleware for a large university, and eventually got sucked into the management borg cube. Writing code is still my happy place, but unfortunately I rarely get to do it any more. I've done stuff in standards development (OASIS SSTC, Kantara Initiative, W3C etc.). C# and .NET are my preference, but I am passable at Python and can pick up other stuff pretty easily.
